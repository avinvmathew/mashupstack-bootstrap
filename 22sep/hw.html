                <dd class = "col-sm-9">Trust is the foundation of any successful team. When team members trust each other, 
                    they feel safe to share ideas, admit mistakes, and take risks without fear of judgment. 
                    This psychological safety encourages open communication and genuine collaboration.

                <dt class = "col-sm-3">2. Accountability</dt>
                <dd class = "col-sm-9">Accountability means that every team member takes ownership of their work and is
                     responsible for their part in the team's success. This isn't about pointing fingers; 
                     it's about a shared commitment to meeting goals and a willingness to follow through on promises.
                </dd>
                <dt class = "col-sm-3">3. Empathy</dt>
                <dd class = "col-sm-9">Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. 
                    In a team setting, empathy helps members appreciate different perspectives, support each other 
                    through challenges, and build a more inclusive and compassionate environment.</dd>
